docker-compose -f {compose file name} up

docker-compose up

docker compose run --build

Pull all updates:
(this will just download the images, not do anything else)

docker-compose pull

And then only update the container you want: 
--no-deps is important to avoid restarting dependencies of your updated containers by mistake.

docker-compose up -d --no-deps name_of_your_container
